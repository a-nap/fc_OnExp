# Forced Choice Task for OnExp

This is an experiment template which allows the experimenter to collect yes/no
answers to questions about sentence stimuli. The experiment consists of the 
following parts:

1. General information
2. Form for inputting general demographic participant information (ID, native
languages, federal state, age, gender, handedness)
3. Instructions
4. Exercise
5. Continue to experiment display
6. Main experiment sequence
7. End screen and experiment explanation

The experiment is in German.

## Task description

The participants are asked to read short sentences and answer a yes/no question
relating to the sentence. The sentence and the question are presented 
simultaneously. In the main experiment procedure, the stimuli presentation 
is shuffled between critical items and distractor sentences.

This template consists of two lists and OnExp automatically assigns participants
to lists. Caution is advised as this assigment can go haywire and ignore the 
participant limit. This is a bug in Onexp and a general methodological concern 
when multiple participants start an experiment simultaneously, e.g. on M-Turk.
